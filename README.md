## Game Plot

In **Cavern of Mars**, you take on the role of a pilot navigating through the treacherous underground caverns of Mars. The story begins with your ship, a state-of-the-art spacecraft, tasked with navigating through dangerous Martian tunnels to gather valuable resources.

As you explore the caverns, you must survive wave after wave of enemies, manage your fuel reserves, and avoid deadly terrain hazards.

### Power-Ups:
#### Fuel

![Image Description](/public/W-fuelTank.PNG)
In Cavern of Mars, fuel is a crucial resource that determines how long you can move through the Martian caverns. Fuel is consumed when you move or perform certain actions. If your fuel runs out, you may face difficulties in moving or performing certain actions, which can lead to mission failure.
#### Fuel Tank

The Fuel Tank is an item you can collect during the game to restore a portion of your fuel supply. Collecting these tanks is essential for staying alive and being able to explore the dangerous tunnels for a longer period of time. Fuel Tanks restore a specific amount of fuel, allowing you to continue exploring and defeating enemies.

### Enemies:

#### Rockets

Rockets in the game are powerful weapons used by enemies to target and damage your ship. They usually lock onto your position and track you across the cavern, making them difficult to avoid. When launched, they home in on your ship, and if they hit, they cause significant damage. The rockets represent one of the more dangerous threats you’ll face, requiring quick reflexes to avoid or destroy them before they hit their mark.

#### Transmitters

Transmitters are enemy objects in the game that serve a strategic purpose. These devices typically emit signals or alerts, making them essential for certain enemy behaviors. When activated, transmitters might trigger the appearance of more enemies or alert other hostile units to your presence, escalating the threat level in the caverns. Destroying these transmitters can help reduce the enemy’s awareness of your location, giving you a better chance to sneak through without attracting too much attention.

### YOUR DESTINATION:
